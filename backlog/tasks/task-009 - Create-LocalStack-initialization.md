## Description

Set up automatic creation of sample AWS resources in LocalStack for testing and demonstration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sample S3 buckets created with test files
- [ ] Sample Lambda functions deployed
- [ ] Sample Step Functions state machines created
- [ ] Initialization runs on container startup
- [ ] Resources visible in UI immediately

## Implementation Notes

LocalStack initialization already implemented and working:\n- Sample S3 buckets (demo-bucket-1, demo-bucket-2, test-uploads) created with test files\n- Sample Lambda functions (hello-world, data-processor) deployed with different configurations\n- Sample Step Functions state machines (SimpleExample, DataProcessingWorkflow) created\n- Initialization script runs automatically on LocalStack container startup\n- All resources are immediately visible in UI after startup\n- Init script located at docker/localstack/init/01-setup-resources.sh\n- Verified all demo resources appear correctly in S3, Lambda, and Step Functions viewers
