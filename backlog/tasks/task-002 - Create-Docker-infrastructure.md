## Description

Set up Docker containers for LocalStack, application, Nginx, and Playwright with proper networking and configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LocalStack Dockerfile configured with S3 Lambda and Step Functions
- [ ] Application Dockerfile with Python dependencies
- [ ] Nginx configuration with SSL certificates
- [ ] Docker Compose files for development and testing
- [ ] All containers can communicate properly

## Implementation Plan

1. Update existing LocalStack Dockerfile to focus on S3, Lambda, Step Functions\n2. Create new application Dockerfile for Python/Starlette app\n3. Update Nginx configuration for localstack-ui routing\n4. Update docker-compose.yaml for new application structure\n5. Update tests/compose.yaml for E2E testing setup\n6. Test all containers start and communicate properly

## Implementation Notes

Updated Docker infrastructure for LocalStack UI:\n- Fixed compose.yaml to use correct Dockerfile paths and service names\n- Updated LocalStack initialization script with sample S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and Step Functions\n- Updated Nginx config to proxy to localstack-ui service\n- Updated test compose.yaml with LocalStack service and proper networking\n- Updated environment files for LocalStack UI configuration\n- Tested that both application and LocalStack containers build successfully\n- All services properly configured for networking and health checks
